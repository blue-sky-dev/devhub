## Why

If you are an open source contributor, have some repositories on GitHub or simply want to discover new projects, DevHub can help you keep up to date with everything relevant that is happening. 

- Manage your notifications;
- Follow repositories without using the `watch` feature so your notifications don't get cluttered;
- Follow user activities without using the `follow` button so they don't know about it;
- Follow user activities that GitHub don't show on your feed, like issue comments and pushed commits;
- See other users dashboards (their home screen) so you can discover new people and repositories.

<br/>

## Features

### Column Layout
