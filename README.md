## Why

If you have one or more repositories on GitHub that you work on or that you really like, the `watch` feature on GitHub is great to follow their activities. The problem is that your notifications on GitHub would get **really** cluttered, with hundreds of new items per week.


So instead of using the built-in `watch` feature, create columns here instead.

<br/>

## Features

Current implementations:

- [x] **GitHub watcher**: Follow GitHub activity without needing to `watch` a repository neither `follow` the user
  - [x] **Dashboard**: See the exact content the user see on their home page
  - [x] **User events**: See all activity made by an user _(starred a repo, ...)_
  - [x] **Repository events**: See all activity happening on a single repo _(released a new version, ...)_
  - [x] **Organization events**: See all activity happening on the whole organization _(merged a pull request, ...)_
- [x] **Notifications manager**
  - [x] **TweetDeck column-style**: Overview all your notifications with easy

Other features:

- [x] **Inbox Zero**: Keep your mind clean by archiving all seem items
- [x] **Theme**: Light or Dark, with the option to automatically change on day/night

Next features:

- [ ] **Notification content**: See the relevant notification content before opening it
- [ ] **Filter**: [soon] Create filters for each column;
- [ ] **Push notification**: [soon] Enable push notifications for your filtered notifications;

> Pull Requests more than welcome!

  ### DevSpace vs DevHub
  
  DevSpace and DevHub started at a similar time.
  One of the main differences between them is that DevHub shows more details about each event (see image below).
  Another difference is that DevHub has native mobile apps, while DevSpace uses only web technologies.

  Octobox is great to manage notifications. We will certainly bring some power features from it to DevHub in the future.
