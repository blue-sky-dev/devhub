# Privacy Policy

## DevHub

### Personal user information
This app requires GitHub authentication.<br/>
These are all permissions that will be requested to you and their reasons:

- [required] `read:user`: Read-only access to the user's profile data;
- [required] `user:email`: Read-only access to the user's e-mail, so DevHub has a way to contact its users if necessary, e.g. security disclosures;
- [required] `notifications`: Read user's public and private notifications; mark as read;


### Diagnostics information
This app uses [Bugsnag](https://bugsnag.com), [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to collect information about crashes and app usage. 
No personal information is ever sent to third parties, only an anonymous id. Services may collect the user's IP. Some device information may be included for debugging purposes, like `brand`, `model` and `operation system`.


### Security & Limited Liability

DevHub follows good practices of security, but 100% security can't be granted in software. DevHub is provided as is without any warranty. Use at your own risk.

Client-side communication is encrypted using HTTPS. Server-side tokens are encrypted or behind environment variables.

DevHub does not access any code from any repository and never asks for this permission.

Client-side token safety is a user's responsibility. We recommend being extra careful with which browser extensions you have installed, for example.


### Support
Feel free to open an issue or contact us via e-mail ([support@devhubapp.com](mailto:support@devhubapp.com)).<br/>
If you find any bug, please contribute by opening an issue or sending a pull request with the fix.
